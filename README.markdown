# FlipFlop

The original purpose of FlipFlop is to offer a handy function to show a
colored diff in a small but dedicated window. On every update, the
former content should be erased. The name *FlipFlop* comes from this
aspect. In addition, a colorscheme different than the other windows have
to be used.
It is designed to show the result of stdiff-cl.
